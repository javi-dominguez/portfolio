> Did you know that even though the American Disability Act, a massive civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability, was enacted in 1990, only 29% of New York Cityâ€™s subway stations are considered ADA accessible?

In the spring of 2021, I was invited to write an article for [Greenhouse's DE&I](https://www.greenhouse.com/guidance/) blog. The article was published in July of 2021, and was successful enough to make it into the permanent rotation of Greenhouse's marketing guides on their website. 

The article is titled [Engineering Accessibility: How to Attract Great Candidates with Software Accessibility](https://www.greenhouse.com/guidance/inclusion-through-tech-how-to-attract-great-candidates-with-software-accessibility). My intentions for this article were to provide a high-level overview of what software accessibility is, and how it can be implemented in a way that is both accessible and inclusive.
