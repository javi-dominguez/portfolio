# Javier Dominguez

Hi, I'm a Software Engineer at [@Grnhse](https://www.greenhouse.com). Currently, I'm working in Ruby on Rails and React. I specialize in building APIs and web applications.

I've always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve problems. In college, I completed several research projects in the field of bioinformatics and chemistry.  

Interested in working together? Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:javierdominguez09@gmail.com).
